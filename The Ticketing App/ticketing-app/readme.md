# Blockchain Ticketing App

The Blockchain Ticketing App is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to mint, transfer, and view non-fungible token (NFT) tickets for events on the Ethereum blockchain. The app is built using Solidity, Truffle, Ganache, Metamask, Streamlit, and the OpenZeppelin library.

## Features

- Mint NFT tickets with event details (event name, date, venue, and price)
- Transfer ownership of tickets between Ethereum addresses
- Display ticket information, including event details and owner

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js 12.x or higher
- Truffle
- Ganache
- Metamask browser extension

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required npm packages:

cd blockchain-ticketing-app
npm install


3. Install the required Python packages:

pip install streamlit web3


## Deploy the Smart Contract

1. Start Ganache to set up a local Ethereum test network:

ganache-cli


2. Compile and deploy the smart contract using Truffle:

truffle compile
truffle migrate


Take note of the contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface) from the deployment output or the `build/contracts/Ticketing.json` file generated by Truffle.

3. Configure Metamask to connect to the Ganache test network:

- Open the Metamask browser extension and connect to the "Localhost 8545" network or create a custom RPC network with the URL `http://localhost:8545`.
- Import the private keys of the Ganache test accounts into Metamask.

## Configure the Streamlit Web App

1. Update the `app.py` file with the Ticketing smart contract ABI and address:

Replace `'ABI'` and `'ADDRESS'` placeholders in the `app.py` file with the actual ABI and contract address obtained in the previous step:

```python
ticketing_abi = 'ABI'
ticketing_address = 'ADDRESS'

## Run the Streamlit Web App
1. Start the Streamlit web app:
streamlit run app.py
